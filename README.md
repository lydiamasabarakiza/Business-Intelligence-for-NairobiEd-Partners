# Business-Intelligence-for-NairobiEd-Partners

## Project Overview
This project aims to assess the Business Intelligence (BI) maturity of NairobiEd Partners, a non-banking financial institution, and provide actionable insights to enhance decision-making through a Power BI dashboard. The dashboard supports key financial and operational areas, including loan performance, market expansion, and repayment risk, while advancing NairobiEd Partners' mission to improve education financing across Africa.

## Features of the Project

1. BI Dashboard Components

- Loan Overview: Trends across loan types, interest rates, and repayment periods.

- Repayment Behavior and Risk: Patterns in loan repayments and default signals.

- Market Expansion Analysis: Evaluation of potential markets for expansion based on metrics like primary school density, corporate tax rates, and ease of setting up a business.

- Education and Infrastructure Assessment: Insights into education systems and infrastructure quality in target countries.

- Key Insights: Summarized data trends for informed decision-making.

2. Report Highlights

- Assessment of current BI maturity using the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI).

- Recommendations for improving data integration, governance, and reporting.

- Analysis of loan performance data to identify repayment trends and default risks.

- Evaluation of market potential in various African countries for strategic expansion.
